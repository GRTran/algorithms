This repository contains sub-folders, containing various algorithmic and numerical solutions using a variety of methods, to example problems. The present subfolders are listed as follows:

- Stochastics

# Stochastics

At present contains a numerical method for solving a stochastic differential equation (SDE) using the Euler-Maruyama method. The stochastic numerical method is applied to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process that is also a Markov process. The stochastic diffusion (volatility) term is sampled from a standard normal distribution.
